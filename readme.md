# Notice
When downloading the HUD's zip file, the extracted folder **MUST** be named `fragmenthud`.

If it is not, then it will NOT work!

Your `<TF2 ROOT>/tf/` folder should look something similar to this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
â”œâ”€â”€ cfg/
â”œâ”€â”€ custom/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fragmenthud/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extd/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frag/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ info.vdf
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ maps/
â”œâ”€â”€ resource/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
