# Donating
TF2 HUD creation and editing is tedious work and everything is provided for free. Donations will give me the ability to work on the project more often and add more features and support for more niche parts of TF2.

## Donation benefits
By donating an amount greater than or equal to **Two (2) Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys**, you get your own section on the HUD, which includes:
- Your name/username
- A text field which you can put whatever you wish (within reason)
- The ability to choose whatever color you want for the section
- (Optional) A link to your Steam profile
- (Optional) The amount you donated
